<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Help is woefully incomplete.</li>
	<li>Find panel doesn't do anything.</li>
	<li>Applescript support isn't very useful.</li>
	<li>The "Open" and "Show in Finder" menu items don't dim properly when the file table
	isn't the first responder.</li>
	<li>The view options do not update based on key window.</li>
	<li>It's possible to get duplicate files if you remove a file from a path, move a new
	file into the same path, and then add the new file to the library. (The old file handle
	now resolves to the new file, and then you add the new file again - using alias data as
	the primary key should fix this, but it's still possible - perhaps alias data isn't
	being updated properly when the new file is found?)</li>
</ul>
