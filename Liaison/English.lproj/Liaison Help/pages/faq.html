	<dt><strong>How do I use groups?</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>You can use <a href="glossary.html#group">groups</a> to organize files
		in your library. For instance, you might want to create a group for all your
		image files, for all the files in a project you're working on, or to share
		files with other Liaison users.</p>
		
		<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%" bgcolor="#fff8dc">
			<tr>
				<td colspan=2><strong>To create a group:</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>1</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					Select "New group" from the File menu.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=2><strong>To add files to a group:</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>1</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					Select the list of files in the library, and drag
					them to the newly created group.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan=2><strong>To rename a group:</strong></td>

	<dt><strong>How do I share my files?</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>You can share any file in your library by putting it in a group.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>How do I download a shared file?</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Double-click on it, or drag it from Liaison to the Finder.</p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>What is meta-data and how do I edit it?</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Meta-data is information about the file itself, such as when it was
		created, to what groups it belongs, its icon, its filename, and other
		ways of referencing a file.</p>
		
		<p>To edit meta-data, you can double click on a field in the file list,
		or edit it via the inspector.</p>
